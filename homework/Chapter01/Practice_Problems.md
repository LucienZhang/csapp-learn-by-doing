# Solutions

## Practice Problem 1.1

### A

$$
\alpha = 1500 / 2500 = 0.6 \\[2mm]
k = 150 / 100 = 1.5 \\[2mm]
S = \frac{1}{(1-\alpha) + \alpha / k}
= \frac{1}{(1-0.6) + 0.6 / 1.5}
= 1.25
$$

The speedup is 1.25x

### B

$$
S = \frac{1}{(1-\alpha) + \alpha / k}
= \frac{1}{(1-0.6) + 0.6 / k}
= 1.67 \\[2mm]
k = 3 \\[2mm]
Speed_{new} = k \times Speed_{old} = 3 \times 100 \ \text{km/hr} = 300 \ \text{km/hr}
$$

You must travel through Montana at 300 km/hr

## Practice Problem 1.2

$$
\alpha = 90\% = 0.9 \\[2mm]
S = \frac{1}{(1-\alpha) + \alpha / k}
= \frac{1}{(1-0.9) + 0.9 / k}
= 4 \\[2mm]
k = 6
$$

you would need to improve this part by 6x
